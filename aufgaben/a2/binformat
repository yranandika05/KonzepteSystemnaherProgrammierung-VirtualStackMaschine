Ninja Binary Format
-------------------

A binary file produced by the assembler, ready for loading into
the Ninja VM, has the following structure:

  4 bytes        'N', 'J', 'B', 'F' (identifies the format)
  4 bytes        version number (must match the VM's version number)
  4 bytes        number of instructions contained in the file
  4 bytes        number of variables in the static data area
  n * 4 bytes    instructions (the program to be executed)


Executing a Binary File
-----------------------

When the Ninja VM wants to load and execute a binary file, the
following actions must be performed:

1) Read the first 4 bytes of the file.
   Verify the format identifier.
   NOTE: There is no terminating null character!

2) Read the version number.
   Verify that this matches the current VM's version number.

3) Read the number of instructions.
   Allocate memory to hold exactly this many instructions.
   NOTE: Instructions, not bytes!

4) Read the numer of variables in the static data area.
   Allocate memory to hold exactly this many variables.
   NOTE: Variables, not bytes!

5) Read the rest of the file into the memory allocated in step 3).

6) Allocate a sufficiently large stack (10000 stack slots are
   enough), either statically, or dynamically via malloc().

7) Set the program counter, the stack pointer, and the frame
   pointer to zero, and begin execution of the program.
