Static Data Area
----------------

The "static data area" is used to store the values of global
variables. It has a constant size, which is given in the binary
program file to be executed (see "Ninja Binary Format").


Push/Pop Instructions for Global Variables
------------------------------------------

The instruction "pushg <n>" pushes a value from the global variable
at position <n> in the static data area onto the stack.

pushg       ...  -->  ... value

The instruction "popg <n>" stores a value into the global variable
at position <n> in the static data area. The value comes from
popping the stack.

popg        ... value  -->  ...

Here is an example: Let us assume that the variabe x resides at
location 2 in the static data area, y at location 5. The statement

    x = 3 * x + y;

can then be executed by the following sequence of instructions:

	pushc	3
	pushg	2
	mul
	pushg	5
	add
	popg	2
