Stack Frames
------------

A "stack frame" is a part of the stack. The "current stack frame"
is the stack area between the stack pointer and the frame pointer.
It holds the local variables of the currently executing procedure.

                         |                  |
                         |                  |
                         |  u n u s e d     |
                         |                  |
stack pointer sp  ---->  |                  |          /|\
                         +------------------+           |
                         |                  |           |
                         |                  |           |
                         |  current frame   |           |
                         |                  |
frame pointer fp  ---->  |                  |   direction of growth
                         +------------------+
                         |                  |
                         |                  |
                         |  previous frame  |
                         |                  |
                         |                  |

The instruction "asf <n>" allocates a new stack frame with
n places for local variables. It works like this:
    push(fp)
    fp = sp
    sp = sp + n

The instruction "rsf" releases the current stack frame and
makes the previous stack frame the current one:
    sp = fp
    fp = pop()


Push/Pop Instructions for Local Variables
-----------------------------------------

The instruction "pushl <n>" pushes a value from the variable
at position n in the current stack frame onto the stack.

pushl       ...  -->  ... value

The instruction "popl <n>" stores a value into the variable at
position n in the current stack frame. The value comes from
popping the stack.

popl        ... value  -->  ...

Here is an example: Let us assume that the variabe x resides at
location 2 in the current stack frame, y at location 5. The statement

    x = 3 * x + y;

can then be executed by the following sequence of instructions:

	pushc	3
	pushl	2
	mul
	pushl	5
	add
	popl	2
