Comparing References
--------------------

In order to be able to execute a statement like
    if (x == nil) {...}
we must push the representation of nil onto the stack
and do a comparison of object references (instead of
comparing the contents of the referenced objects).
Thus we have three new instructions for the VM:

pushn       ...  -->  ... nil
refeq       ... ref1 ref2  -->  ... ref1==ref2
refne       ... ref1 ref2  -->  ... ref1!=ref2

The representation of nil can simply be the NULL pointer.
We then also define the value of instance variables (i.e.,
variables within records and arrays) to be nil initially.
The same definition holds for local and global variables.
Note that the VM is responsible for this initialization.
