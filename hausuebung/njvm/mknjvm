# You may choose to build the files:
# - by hand (directly with gcc)
# - via make
# - via cmake
#
# in any case, make sure that at theend of the compilation process, the resulting file 
# is called njvm and is located in the same directory as this script mknjvm.

# The following line is an example for 

echo gcc -g -Wall -std=c99 -pedantic -o njvm src/njvm.c
